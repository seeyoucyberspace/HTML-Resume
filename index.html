                    <p>
                        Hi, my name is Sergey, I am a beginner QA engineer and I don't have a work experience so far. Despite this, now I'm putting all my efforts and time into self-education to become a junior developer. In my free time I constantly improve and expand my knowledge,
                        mixing theory with practice.
                        <p>I've tried different directions and languages and choose a QA position because;</p>
                        <p> - It's a scrupulous, thoughtful work.</p>
                        <p> - You have to look for new approaches</p>
                        <p>- You see the result of your work and understand</p>
                        <p>- There is a lot to develop, because the direction</p>
                        <p>Despite the process of my self-education I still have no experience in serious IT projects. And I realise that this is a serious argument against me as an employee. Therefore, I will primarily focus on my personal skills and experience
                            outside of IT to improve myself. Here are a few of my personal skills that I hope can help me compensate my lack of experience with more than just persistence:</p>
                        <p> - My English is B1. I understand texts, can communicate by writing and able to conversate with overseas colleagues if necessary.</p>
                        <p>- I have a lot of enthusiasm. In all my previous jobs I spent a lot of time for practice, I was interested in extra shifts and studied theory in my free time to improve my level as a professional</p>.
                        <p>- I am a team player. All of my jobs have been in a team environment, so I know how to maintain a friendly atmosphere that doesn't interfere with work. </p>
                        <p>Thank you for your consideration! I assure you, if you give me a chance, I will do my best.</p>
